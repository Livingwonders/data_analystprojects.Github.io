									<h2><a href="#">NovaMed Solutions Sales Performance Analysis</a></h2>
									<p>This is an insight-driven project with dataset of customers across countries and continents especially America and Europe for better sales Performance. Key performance indicators show a robust profit margin over the past 4 years, with stable month-over-month growth. Also, customer concentration and seasonal dips in mid-year margins signal the need for retention strategies and counter-seasonal campaigns. Our recommendations to the company improves customer retention by 15% within 4 months and with possibility of improving to 35% within a year. The analysis was carried out using Excel & Power BI.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Employee Retention, Performance Variability & Correlation with their Salary Using SQL tool</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/etactics-inc-UPNc5CcL2L8-unsplash.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project focused on analyzing employee retention trends across departments using SQL. Using PostgreSQL, I queried and combined employee, department, salary, attendance and turnover datasets to identify high-attrition areas and reveal underperforming teams. The analysis was used by HR to shape better retention strategies, including targeted support for at-risk roles. Findings showed that most turnover occurred in Marketing and Sales departments. I analyzed employee performance across the departments and highlighted top-performing teams. The leadership implemented recommendations provided from the project such as Offer career growth opportunities for employees with high risk of leaving. As a result, the company recorded a 25% increase in employee performance and reduction of attrition within the five months of its application. The project proved how SQL-driven insight can directly impact business outcomes. Clean logic, clear communication, and stakeholder alignment were key to success. This remains one of my most impactful, insight-led HR analytics projects to date.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Employee Attrition Analysis Using Tableau tool</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/benjamin-child-GWe0dlVD9e0-unsplash.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This Tableau dashboard was developed to explore employee attrition trends and identify key drivers of turnover. Using interactive filters by department, age, gender, and job role, I uncovered that mid-level employees with 2–5 years of experience—particularly in Sales and HR—had the highest attrition rates. Key factors included limited career progression and low job involvement. Based on these insights, the company implemented retention strategies that led to a 15% improvement in employee retention within three months. The dashboard supported HR in making informed, data-led decisions around talent engagement and development.</p>
